Raspberry Pi Pico is a development board that uses Raspberry Pi xref:../microcontrollers/microcontroller-chips.adoc[microcontrollers] (*RP2040* or *RP2350*). A Raspberry Pi Pico is programmed using *MicroPython*, *C*, or *{cpp}* and, unlike other Raspberry Pi devices, doesn't run Linux or support removable storage. Instead, Raspberry Pi Pico is programmed by flashing binaries to the on-board flash memory.

There are two generations of the Raspberry Pi Pico series:

* <<pico1>> (Pico 1)
* <<pico2>>

Each generation is available in four variants, which differ based on:

* *Wireless connectivity.* Variants that include the *W* suffix in the name include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
* *Presoldered headers.* Variants are available either as castellated modules (for direct soldering) or with presoldered pin headers.

== Raspberry Pi Pico

The first generation of Raspberry Pi Pico is based on the xref:../microcontrollers/microcontroller-chips.adoc#rp2040[RP2040] microcontroller chip. It comes in four variants, listed in <<variants, Table 1>>. For more detail about the variants, see <<non-wireless_pico>> (Raspberry Pi *Pico* and *Pico H*) and <<wireless_pico>> (Raspberry Pi *Pico W* and Pico *WH*).

[[wireless_models]]
== Wireless models

Wireless Raspberry Pi Pico models (Raspberry Pi *Pico W*, *Pico WH*, *Pico 2 W*, and *Pico 2 W with headers*) integrate Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity directly into the board, making them suitable for connected and IoT applications, without requiring external radio modules.

=== Wireless hardware and antenna

Wireless Raspberry Pi Pico models use the *Infineon CYW43439* wireless chip, connected to the on-board microcontroller through an SPI interface operating at up to 33 MHz. Raspberry Pi *Pico W* and *Pico WH* also feature an on-board antenna licensed from *ABRACON* (formerly ProAnt).

Because this wireless subsystem shares some of the pins, some interface signals are multiplexed with other board functions.

* The SPI clock line (`CLK`) is shared with the `VSYS` voltage monitor, and so the ADC can only read `VSYS` when no SPI transaction is in progress.
* The Infineon CYW43439 `DIN/OUT` and `IRQ` signals share a pin, so you can only check for interrupted requests (IRQ) when no SPI transaction is in progress.

For optimal wireless performance, keep the antenna space free. Placing metal near or under the antenna can significantly reduce signal gain and bandwidth; grounded metal placed along the sides of the antenna can improve the antenna's bandwidth.

=== Wireless software licensing

The software libraries, `libcyw43` and `BTstack`, are free to use for non-commercial projects. However, Raspberry Pi has negotiated special commercial rights for Raspberry Pi Pico and microcontroller users. This means that users are granted a free license for commercial use for projects built with Raspberry Pi *Pico W*, *Pico WH*, or a combination of RP2040 and CYW43439.

[[layouts]]
== Board layouts
Raspberry Pi Pico boards provide minimal external circuitry to support the microcontroller chip. This section describes the physical layout and pin assignments (pinouts) of Raspberry Pi Pico boards. Non-wireless Raspberry Pi Pico boards share a common layout and pinout, as do wireless Raspberry Pi Pico boards.

[[layout_non-wireless]]
=== Non-wireless board layout

<<non-wireless-pinout-pico, Figure 3>> and <<non-wireless-pinout-pico2, Figure 4>> provide a top-down view of non-wireless Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico 2 boards, including their pinouts. Aside from minor visual differences, the main layout is the same for all non-wireless boards: Raspberry *Pico*, *Pico H*, *Pico 2*, and *Pico 2 with headers*. The only major visual difference between these non-wireless boards is the presence or absence of presoldered headers, and the exact nature of the SWD interface; for more information, see <<swd>>.

Broadly, a non-wireless Raspberry Pi Pico board is laid out as follows:

* The Micro USB port for power and data is located at the top edge of the board.
* The LED (connected to `GP25`) is located to the left of the Micro USB port.
* The *BOOTSEL* button is located under the USB port and to the left side of the board.
* The microcontroller chip is located near the middle of the board.
* The *DEBUG* pads (SWD interface) are located at the bottom edge of the board. For more information, see <<swd>>.
* 40 pins are located on the left and right edges of the board, 20 on each side. For more information, see <<pin_functions>>.

image::images/pico2w-pinout.svg[]

Broadly, a wireless Raspberry Pi Pico board is laid out as follows:

* The Micro USB port for power and data is located at the top edge of the board.
* The LED (connected to the wireless chip through `WL_GPIO0`) is located to the left of the Micro USB port.
* The *BOOTSEL* button is located under the USB port and to the left side of the board.
* The microcontroller chip is located near the middle of the board.
* The *DEBUG* pads (SWD interface) are located below the microcontroller and to the right. For more information, see <<swd>>.
* 40 pins are located on the left and right edges of the board, 20 on each side. For more information, see <<pin_functions>>.

[[pin_functions]]
=== Pin functions

The majority of the microcontroller pins are brought to the user I/O pins on the left and right edges of the board. Four microcontroller I/O pins are used for internal functions: driving an LED, on-board Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) power control, and sensing system voltages. Aside from the ground (`GND`) pins, the 40 pins on the left and right side of a non-wireless Pico board include:

* 26 GPIO pins with overlapping functions (SPI, I2C, UART, and so on) that can be configured for different project needs.
* Power pins located in the top-right of the board, including:
    ** `3V3(OUT)` at pin 36 (3.3 V regulated output).
    ** `VSYS` at pin 29 (2 V to 5 V system input).
    ** `VBUS` at pin 40 (5 V input from USB).
* Special-purpose pins:
    ** `3V3_EN` at pin 37. Pulling this pin to ground turns off the Raspberry Pi Pico.
    ** `ADC_VREF` at pin 35. Provides the reference voltage for ADC converters.
    ** `AGND` at pin 33 (also a `GND` pin). An analogue ground used to provide noise-free ground for sensors.
    ** `RUN` at pin 30. The microcontroller reset pin.

[[swd]]
== Debug connector (SWD)

All Raspberry Pi Pico boards include a three-pin *Serial Wire Debug (SWD)* header, which is the connector for programming and debugging the built-in microcontroller on the board.

The three-pin connector always carries `SWDIO` (Serial Wire Debug data), `GND` (ground), and `SWCLK` (Serial Wire Debug clock). There's no power pin on this connector. Your Raspberry Pi Pico board must be powered separately over USB or `VSYS`.

The connector's location and type differs depending on the board variant, summarised in <<debug, Table 3>>. To compare the visual difference between the SWD headers, see <<pico1-image, Figure 1>> in the introduction for <<pico1>> and <<pico2-image, Figure 2>> in the introduction for <<pico2>>.

|===

=== Debug connector locations

The location of the debug connector depends on whether the board is a non-wireless or wireless variant:

* On non-wireless variants (Raspberry Pi *Pico*, *Pico H*, *Pico 2*, and *Pico 2 with headers*), the connector is located at the bottom of the board. For a diagram that shows the location of the debug connector on non-wireless boards, see <<layout_non-wireless>>.
* On wireless variants (Raspberry Pi *Pico W*, *Pico WH*, *Pico 2 W*, and *Pico 2 W with headers*), the connector is located underneath the microcontroller chip nearer the middle of the board. For a diagram that shows the location of the debug connector on wireless boards, see <<layout_wireless>>.

=== Debug connector types

The connector type depends on whether the board has presoldered headers:

* Boards without presoldered headers (Raspberry Pi *Pico*, *Pico W*, *Pico 2* and *Pico 2 W*) use three castellated through-hole pads.
* Boards with presoldered headers (Raspberry Pi *Pico H*, *Pico WH*, *Pico 2 with headers*, and *Pico 2 W with headers*) use a small, keyed three-pin connector (JST-style). For information about this connector, see https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/debug/debug-connector-specification.pdf[Raspberry Pi 3-pin Debug Connector Specification].

The debug connectors on Raspberry Pi Pico boards with headers fit the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe with no modification. For more information, see xref:../microcontrollers/debug-probe.adoc[Debug Probe].

== Software utilities

This section describes software tools and utilities available for Raspberry Pi Pico-series devices, including tools for device inspection, debugging, and flash memory management.

=== Identify what has been programmed

If you're unsure about what's currently programmed on your Raspberry Pi Pico, and the program was built using the Pico C or {cpp} SDK, the binary typically contains metadata such as the application name and version information.

Use the `picotool` command-line to extract and display this information. For more information, see our https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool[picotool GitHub repository].

=== Debug using a Pico-series device

One Raspberry Pi Pico-series device can be used to debug another by running `debugprobe`, which enables a Raspberry Pi Pico to function as a USB-to-SWD and UART converter. To install the `debugprobe` firmware:

. Download the latest firmware release form the debugprobe GitHub repository:
    * `debugprobe_on_pico.uf2` for the first generation of Raspberry Pi Pico.
    * `debugprobe_on_pico2.uf2` for Raspberry Pi Pico 2.
. On the Raspberry Pi Pico that you intend to use as a debugger, hold down the *BOOTSEL* button at the same time as you connect it to your computer. A USB mass storage device named *RPI-RP2* appears and is mounted as a volume.
. Copy the appropriate UF2 file to the mounted volume. The volume automatically ejects after the transfer completes.
. Wait for the device to reboot. Your device now runs the `debugprobe` firmware and you can start using it as a debugger.

=== Reset flash memory

`BOOTSEL` mode resides in read-only memory, inside the microcontroller chip on the Raspberry Pi Pico board; it can't be re-written. As a result, holding the *BOOTSEL* button while connecting the board always presents the device as a USB mass storage device, ensuring that the board can't be permanently bricked through software.

If you want to erase the external flash memory, you can copy a special https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/soft/flash_nuke.uf2[UF2 file] to the Raspberry Pi Pico device while it's in `BOOTSEL` mode. For the code to erase the external flash memory, see our https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/flash/nuke/nuke.c[pico-examples GitHub repository].

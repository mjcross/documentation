Raspberry Pi designs its own *microcontrollers*, which are standalone silicon chips for small embedded projects that provide real-time hardware control. These chips are used in Raspberry Pi *Pico* boards and can be used in third-party microcontroller boards. For more information about Raspberry Pi Pico, see xref:../microcontrollers/pico-series.adoc[Pico microcontroller boards].

Raspberry Pi microcontrollers can be programmed using:

* *C* or *{cpp}*, which are performance focussed and provide full control over hardware.
* *MicroPython*, which provides simpler scripting for rapid development.

For more information on developing with RP2040 or RP2350, see the xref:c_sdk.adoc#sdk-setup[C/{cpp} SDK] and xref:micropython.adoc#what-is-micropython[MicroPython] documentation.

== Microcontroller overview

Raspberry Pi microcontrollers are silicon chips that handle specific, real-time tasks, like controlling motors or reading sensors, in embedded systems. Raspberry Pi offers two microcontrollers:

* xref:../microcontrollers/microcontroller-chips.adoc#rp2040[RP2040] is the original, general-purpose, dual-core Raspberry Pi microcontroller: a simple, cost-effective microcontroller unit (MCU).
* xref:../microcontrollers/microcontroller-chips.adoc#rp2350[RP2350] is a high-performance, dual-core microcontroller for applications with flexible hardware control; it's a more powerful MCU with advanced features, memory, and security. RP2350 has four variants, described in xref:../microcontrollers/microcontroller-chips.adoc#RP2350_variants[RP2350 variants].

=== Key features

Both RP2040 and RP2350 share the following core features:

* *Dual-core processors* for parallel processing.
* *On-chip SRAM* for real-time workloads.
* *Deterministic bus fabric* through a multi-master AHB crossbar that connects the CPUs, DMA, and peripherals to multi-bank SRAM.
* *Built-in USB controller and PHY* that allows the microcontroller to act as either a USB device or USB host.
* *Flexible general-purpose I/O (GPIO)* that can be configured for digital input/output or assigned to peripheral functions like UART, SPI, I2C, or PWM.
* *Programmable I/O (PIO)*, a unique feature of Raspberry Pi microcontrollers that provides extended peripheral support.
* *Built-in hardware peripherals* for interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, and so on, reducing software overhead and improving efficiency.
* *High performance, low power consumption, and low power leakage* as a result of the modern 40 nm manufacturing process for microcontrollers.
* *Low-power modes* to support extended-duration operation on battery power.
* *Programming options* with C/{cpp} SDK or MicroPython; you can run Python through the MicroPython port and program it using the UF2 bootloader built into ROM for drag-and-drop programming.

=== Feature comparison

The following table provides a comparison between RP2040 and RP2350 microcontrollers.

== USB identifiers

Many RP2040 and RP2350 chips use a combination of Raspberry Pi USB identifiers (Vendor ID and Product ID). If you make your own, third-party board based on RP2040 or RP2350, you might need a unique USB Product ID (PID) if:

* You need to provide a custom Windows driver.
* You want your device to be uniquely identifiable as a separate product.

Raspberry Pi has permission from USB-IF to licence USB PID values for its Vendor ID (`0x2E8A`) for common silicon components used with RP2040 and RP2350. This means that you can assign unique PIDs under our Vendor ID (`0x2E8A`). To reserve a USB PID associated with Raspberry Pi's Vendor ID, follow the instructions in the https://github.com/raspberrypi/usb-pid[Raspberry Pi USB PID Git repository].

If you don't need a unique PID, you can still uniquely distinguish devices using any of the following USB text fields: `iManufacturer`, `iProduct`, and `iSerial`.

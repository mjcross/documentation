= RP1 I/O controller

*RP1* is an in-house silicon chip built into later-generation Raspberry Pi computers to manage their peripherals, such as USB, Ethernet, GPIO, and storage interfaces. It complements the main processor by moving high-speed serial interfaces off the more expensive process node.

Unlike Raspberry Pi xref:../microcontrollers/microcontroller-chips.adoc[microcontrollers], RP1 isn't a standalone chip; it's an I/O controller built into Raspberry Pi 5 and Compute Module 5. As a built-in I/O controller, RP1 isn't sold separately but people do write software for it, which is why it's described here.

NOTE: RP1 isn't short for the first Raspberry Pi single-board computer (Raspberry Pi Model B).

== RP1 overview

RP1 measures approximately 12 x 12 mm in a BGA package with 0.65 mm pin spacing. It connects to the main CPU (BCM2712) on a Raspberry Pi 5 and Compute Module 5 over a PCIe 2.0 x4 link, and handles most external I/O.

RP1 complements the main processor by managing peripherals and offloading I/O tasks from the main CPU. This continues Raspberry Pi's traditional two-chip architecture where the CPU manages core processing and a companion chip (in this case, RP1) manages peripherals. For more information, see <<interfaces>>.

RP1 also integrates several internal system components to support high-performance, low-latency I/O operation. For more information, see <<features>>.

RP1 includes dedicated multimedia and audio hardware to support display outputs, cameras, and basic audio functionality. For more information, see <<multimedia>>.

[[interfaces]]
== Peripheral interfaces

RPI provides the following peripheral interfaces:

* 4-lane PCIe 2.0 endpoint
* Gigabit Ethernet MAC
* Two USB host controllers (providing more than twice the usable USB bandwidth compared to Raspberry Pi 4), each with:
    ** One USB 3.0 port
    ** One USB 2.0 port
* Two SDIO/eMMC interfaces (not used on Raspberry Pi 5)
* Two 4-lane MIPI transceivers supporting DSI and CSI-2 for display and camera interfaces
* Low-speed peripherals, including:
    ** SPI
    ** UART
    ** I2C
    ** PWM
    ** GPIO
    ** I2S

[[features]]
== Internal features

RP1 integrates the following internal system components:

* Two Cortex M3 processors with tightly-coupled memories
* An 8-channel DMA controller
* Multiple PLLs
* A 12-bit ADC with temperature sensor
* 64 kB shared SRAM
* Timing generator

[[multimedia]]
== Multimedia and audio components

RP1 includes the following multimedia and audio blocks for video output and simple audio generation without external codecs:

* Video DAC (3-channel, supporting PAL/NTSC and VGA; only one composite channel used on Raspberry Pi 5).
* DPI video frame generator for displays connected to GPIO pins.
* CSI-2 receiver, DMA and ISP front-end for framing and statistics generation for cameras connected to the MIPI ports.
* DSI DMA and transmitter for displays connected to the MIPI ports.
* Delta-sigma PWM audio out.
* PDM microphone clock generator and stereo bitstream input.

== RP1 naming

Raspberry Pi silicon chips follow a naming convention that starts with **RP** to refer to 'Raspberry Pi', followed by a number. The number in the I/O controller refers to the chip's generation, being the first embedded I/O controller chip.
